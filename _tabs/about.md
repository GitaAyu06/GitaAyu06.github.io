I'm an AI enthusiast with a background as a Business Intelligence specialist at Shopee Indonesia, where I developed key data analysis and automation skills, particularly for the Shopee Affiliate program. A Computer Engineering honors graduate from Universitas Indonesia, I specialize in AI and hold certifications in data science and machine learning from Google and Coursera. Co-founder of BACARA, a recognized sign language translation app, I am currently enhancing my AI and machine learning expertise at Imperial College London, aspiring to be a leader and innovator in AI and data science.
